# Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp - Project 1
We want to analyze changes in trends in the housing market of NYC before and
after the COVID-19 lockdown on 2019.
## Problem statement
Analyze trends in housing availability in NYC between 2013 and 2023.  Take into
consideration regional and overall trends in employment/income, population,
mortgage interest rates (to adjust for inflation), and metrics of housing real
estate (units available, units in region, unit price average/median, etc.)
## Team
The team has chosen team name Houseketeers, and is composed of (in alphabetical
order by surname):
* Elif Celebi
* Zaineb Konialian
* Carlos Ortiz
* Talibah Timothy
  
## Background
Historically there was generally a negative correlation between housing prices
and interest rates.  However, in 2023 - 2024, there has been a positive
correlation.  What is driving housing prices to still remain high even though
there are higher interest rates?

## Files for instruction team review
